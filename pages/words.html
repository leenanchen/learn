          Powerful words or speeches that can have a significant impact on
          people’s lives and actions. These words may come from leaders,
          mentors, family members, or friends and have the ability to inspire
          people to pursue their dreams, overcome obstacles, and even change
          society. Therefore, “Words That Work Miracles” can be seen as a phrase
          that represents inspiring, motivational, and impactful language that
          can create profound change.

            "Good words cost nothing, but are worth much," said Thomas Fuller,
            the 17th century British scholar. They serve to give encouragement
            and smooth away differences and misunderstandings, as this article
            explains.

          "Maybe when I'm a hundred, I'll get used to having everything I do
          taken for granted," a young homemaker confided to her neighbor. If
          Bill would compliment me once in a while, he'd make my life much
          happier."

          Few of us realize how much we need encouragement. Yet we must bask in
          the warmth of approval now and then or lose our self-confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of us need to feel needed and admired. But unless we hear words of
          praise from someone else, how can we know that we are valued friends
          or co-workers?
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone who wants to improve his relationships with others need only
          show a sympathetic understanding. The way to express this
          understanding and to give others the feeling of importance and
          worthiness boils down to this: always look for something in the other
          person you can admire and praise and tell him about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We each have a mental picture of ourselves, a self-image. To find life
          reasonably satisfying, that self-image must be one we can live with,
          one we can like. When we are proud of our self-image, we feel
          confident and free to be ourselves. We function at our best. When we
          are ashamed of our self-image, we attempt to hide it rather than
          express it. We become hostile and hard to get along with.

          A miracle happens to the person whose self-esteem has been raised. He
          suddenly likes other people better. He is kinder and more cooperative
          with those around him. Praise is the polish that helps keep his
          self-image bright and sparkling.
        </p>
        <p>
          What has this to do with your giving praise? A lot. You have the
          ability to perform that kind of miracle in another person. When you
          add to his self-esteem, you make him want to like you and to cooperate
          with you.
        </p>

          In a classic bit of advice, Lord Chesterfield suggested to his son
          that he follow the example of the Duke de Nivernois: "You will
          perceive that he makes people pleased with him by making them first
          pleased with themselves."
        </p>
        <p>
          The effects of praise can be great indeed. A new minister called to a
          church jokingly referred to as "the refrigerator". decided against
          criticizing his congregation for its collness to toward strangers.
          Instead, he began welcoming visitors from the pulpit and telling his
          flock how friendly they were. Time after time he held up a picture of
          the church as he wanted it to be, giving his people a reputation to
          live up to. The congregation thawed. "Praise transformed the ice-cube
          members into warmhearted human beings," he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sincerity is essential in giving praise. It lends potency to a
          compliment. Coming home after a hard day's work, the man who sees the
          faces of his children pressed against the window, watching for him,
          can water his soul with their silent but golden opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Praise helps rub off the sharp edges of daily contact. No where is
          this truer than in marriage. Yet it is perhaps in the home that the
          value of praise is less appreciated than else where. The spouse who is
          alert to say the heartening thing at the right moment has learned one
          of the most important requirements for a happy family life.
        </p>

          Children, especially, are hungry for praise, reassurance and
          appreciation. A young mother told her pastor of a heart rending
          incident:
        </p>
        <p>
          "My little boy often misbehaves, and I have to scold him. But one day
          he had been especially good. That night, after I tucked him in bed and
          started downstairs, I heard him crying. I found his head buried in the
          pillow. Between sobs he asked, 'Mommy, haven't I been a pretty good
          boy today?'"
        </p>
        <p>
          "That question went through me like a knife," the mother said. "I had
          been quick to correct him when he did wrong, but when he had behaved,
          I hadn't noticed. I had put him to bed without a word of praise."
        </p>
        <p>
          Take the trouble to find something to commend in your child, and you
          will discover that both his ability and attitude will improve.
          Encouragement through praise is the most effective method of getting
          people to do their best.
        </p>
        <p>
          As artists find joy in giving beauty to others, so anyone who masters
          the art of praising will find that it blesses the giver as much as the
          receiver. There is truth in the saying, "Flowers leave part of their
          fragrance in the hand that bestows them."
